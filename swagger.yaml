  title: Nexumed API - Work Order Upload
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    This API allows EMRs to send patient work order files to Nexumed for secure processing and device-specific routing.

    **Security**: All requests must be sent over HTTPS.

    ---
    **Endpoints Overview**:
    - `POST /api/work-order-emr`: Basic file upload where the procedure type is **determined automatically** from the file content.
    - `POST /api/receive-file`: Advanced file upload where the procedure type is **explicitly provided** via a query parameter.

  # /api/work-order-emr:
  #   post:
  #     summary: Upload work order file from EMR (procedure detected automatically)
  #     description: |
  #       This endpoint allows an EMR to send a patient work order file (XML, HL7, or GDT) to Nexumed for processing.

  #       **How it works:**
  #       - The uploaded file will be analyzed by Nexumed to automatically detect the procedure type (e.g., ECG, BP, etc.).
  #       - No need to specify the procedure manually.
  #       - Requires the `drsID` query parameter to identify the sending doctor or practice.

  #       **When to use this:**  
  #       Use this endpoint if your system cannot determine the procedure type in advance or prefers to leave routing decisions to Nexumed.

  /api/receive-file:
    post:
      summary: Upload work order file with explicit procedure routing
      description: |
        This endpoint allows an EMR to send a patient work order file (XML) to Nexumed **along with the intended procedure type** for direct routing to the appropriate device or service.

        **How it works:**
        - The `procedure` query parameter explicitly tells Nexumed what type of procedure this file represents (e.g., ECG, BP, Spiro, etc.).
        - This allows Nexumed to route the file immediately without analyzing its content.
        - Requires both the `drsID` and `procedure` query parameters.

        **When to use this:**  
        Use this endpoint if your system knows the procedure type in advance and you want faster, more direct routing.
